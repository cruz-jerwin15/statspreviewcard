### What I learned

This is my fifth challenge and I learned a lot. This is the first time I did not use <img> tags and I include the image in the background of a divider. I also use  opacity and overflow: hidden. I learn on how to use flexbox. Create a responsive web app using the Mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

I want to focus first on how I can improve my designing skills for small components with the use of HTML and CSS only.
